            <h1>Travel</h1>
           <p class="para">I love to travel because not only is it the ultimate adventure but it also <br>
              exposes me to new types of people,different ways of living, and opens up my mind.<br>
              Travel puts me out of my comfort zone and inherently breeds challenges.I'm a firm<br>
              believer that challenges leads to curiosity,maturity and growth.I love to explore new places.I love travelling<br>
              beacuse it displaces me.If we go with an open mind,we discover things about ourself,<br>
              about others and about the world we would have not learned otherwie.I'm originally from<br>
              Coorg,so I try to take advantage of everything that the Nature has to offer.

           <h1>Book</h1>
           <p class="para">We all have a uniquely valuable role in life.But many of us,even if satisfied with <br>
            that role,often wonder what it would be like to live in a different place,work at a<br>
            different job,or even be a completely different person.Reading allows me to experience<br>
            multiple realities.I push myself to interact with meaningless lines and squiggles until<br>
            they transform into stories,characters and ideas and this drives me to be a reader.

            <h1>Food</h1>
        <p class="para">Food is often the reason why people travel!After all,there is no better way to<br>
            appreciate a culture than by sampling local flavours,It could be in fancy resturants,<br>
            humble hole-in-the-wall eateries or cheap food carts on the street.Food is art,I believe.<br>
            So I love to try variety of dishes,desserts in different places.

            <h1>Painting</h1>
        <p class="para">I was obsessed with painting from a young age.Painting allows me to express my feelings<br>
             without words.In free time I use to paint,I love colors.</p>
